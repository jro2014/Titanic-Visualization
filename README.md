# Titanic-Visualizatoin
This was the final poster project for the IST 719 - Information Visualization. The focus was on the visualizations and the composition of the poster.

The project utilized the training set from the Titanic dataset and looked at some relationships between the variables. Two predictive models were created and visualized, but were not applied to the test set as that was outside the scope of the class. 

The visualizations were created using the ggplot2 package in R and then edited in Adobe Illustrator to create the final product.
